# Microscopy Image Super-Resolution using SRGAN
### TensorFlow 2.x • NVIDIA RTX 3060 • VGG19 Perceptual Loss • Custom Augmentation Pipeline

## 🔬 Overview

This repository implements a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (**SRGAN**) 
designed to enhance low-resolution bright-field microscopy images of fly wing (32×32) to high-resolution (128×128).  
The full workflow includes:

- Raw image patch extraction  
- Rotation & flip augmentations  
- LR/HR paired dataset generation  
- GPU-accelerated SRGAN training (Generator + Discriminator)  
- Perceptual loss using VGG19 features  
- Evaluation with PSNR / SSIM / MSE  

This work was partially presented in a conference poster (included below).

## 🐝 Why Fly Wing Images?

Fly wings were selected as the microscopy target because they naturally contain both 
**fine microstructures** (hair-like ridges, thin membrane textures) and **coarse macro-structures** (veins and large geometric patterns).  
This combination makes them an ideal testbed for super-resolution research.

Using fly wings allowed us to evaluate whether SRGAN can recover both:
- **High-frequency details** (texture, thin edges)
- **Large-scale structure** (vein geometry, global shape)

In practice, the fly wing dataset provides a rich balance of detail and structure, making it a strong candidate for validating microscopy super-resolution models.

## 🧪 Example Results

A real microscopy example (32×32 → 128×128):

| Low-Resolution | SRGAN Output | Ground Truth |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| ![](examples/example_lr.png) | ![](examples/example_sr.png) | ![](examples/example_hr.png) |

The SRGAN successfully reconstructs edge continuity, fine texture, and structural details from heavily downsampled inputs.

## 📊 Quantitative Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **PSNR** | 29.40 dB |
| **SSIM** | 0.85 |

## ⚡ GPU Acceleration

Training was performed on:

- **NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12 GB)**  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` for multi-GPU compatibility  

```python
print("Num GPUs Available:", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices("GPU")))
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
```

SRGAN training on CPU is not practical — GPU is strongly recommended.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Pipeline

All preprocessing steps are implemented in:

```text
src/preprocess_patches.py
```

### Steps:
- Extract **128×128** HR patches from raw microscopy images  
- Apply augmentation:  
  - 90°, 180°, 270° rotations  
  - Vertical flips  
- Generate **32×32** LR patches by downsampling  
- Save paired LR/HR images for SRGAN training
