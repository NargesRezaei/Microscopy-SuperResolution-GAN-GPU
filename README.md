# Microscopy Image Super-Resolution using SRGAN
### TensorFlow 2.x • NVIDIA RTX 3060 • VGG19 Perceptual Loss • Custom Augmentation Pipeline

## 🔬 Overview

This repository implements a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (**SRGAN**) 
designed to enhance low-resolution microscopy images (32×32) to high-resolution (128×128).  
The full workflow includes:

- Raw image patch extraction  
- Rotation & flip augmentations  
- LR/HR paired dataset generation  
- GPU-accelerated SRGAN training (Generator + Discriminator)  
- Perceptual loss using VGG19 features  
- Evaluation with PSNR / SSIM / MSE  

This work was partially presented in a conference poster (included below).

## 🧪 Example Results

A real microscopy example (32×32 → 128×128):

| Low-Resolution | SRGAN Output | Ground Truth |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| ![](examples/example_lr.png) | ![](examples/example_sr.png) | ![](examples/example_hr.png) |

The SRGAN successfully reconstructs edge continuity, fine texture, and structural details from heavily downsampled inputs.

## ⚡ GPU Acceleration

Training was performed on:

- **NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12 GB)**  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` for multi-GPU compatibility  

```python
print("Num GPUs Available:", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices("GPU")))
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
